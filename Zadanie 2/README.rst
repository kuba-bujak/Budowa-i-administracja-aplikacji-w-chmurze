Monitoring with prometheus for Go, Py, and Java
===============================================

You will find demos that shows hwo to use prometheus to monitor your service in your favortie language. 

I extracted the demos from my previous talks to have them all in one repo:

- java - `JUGW Meetup Warsaw <https://github.com/wojciech12/talk_java_2018_prometheus>`_
- python - `PyCode 2018 <https://github.com/wojciech12/talk_pycode_2018_monitoring>`_
- golang - `Golang Warsaw Meetup 2018 <https://github.com/wojciech12/talk_gowaw_RED_metrics_with_prometheus_stack>`_

My recommendation, start with monitoring before investing in the centralized logging (`demo of EFK-stack <https://github.com/wojciech12/talk_observability_logging>`_) and, long before, introducing tracing.
